"""A number stated in a reference document is bound to the thing that decides it.

A reference page that says "ten teaching programs" is asserting a fact about the
build, and nothing computed it. The number was typed by whoever last counted, and
it goes stale the way every uncomputed number goes stale — silently, in the
direction of the tree moving on. This is not a tidiness concern: an authoring
session reads `grammar.md` §2c to decide what the language can express, and "the
nine below" over a table of ten is a page that tells it a technique does not
exist.

THE SHAPE THIS EXISTS FOR — an integration, not an edit. Two branches changed the
idiom index's *intent*. One added a tenth technique (`idiom-arguments`) and moved
the count in `tools.md`, `prefab-procedure.md`, the `/new-delve` skill and the
index table. The other, which never touched the library, added a section above
that table opening "Not a tenth technique and not a row in the table: the nine
below…". `git merge-tree` resolves the pair with ZERO conflict markers — they are
different regions of the file — and the merged tree ships a page whose own
sentence contradicts its own table three lines down. `check-doc-dupes`,
`check-dw-codes`, `check-reference-versions` and `check-grammar-ir-compat` are
all green on that tree. Docs merge as text and are never re-read; a textual
conflict count measures nothing (CLAUDE.md).

WHAT THIS CHECKS. Not the idiom count. An idiom-count check would be keyed to the
verb that first needed it, and the next reference page to state a number would
have no surface — so the fix would look like a second bespoke check, which is the
defect rather than the fix (CLAUDE.md: a capability belongs to the object class
it acts on). The object class is *a count stated in prose*, and the machinery is:

  ORACLE    a named computation over the tree that yields the true number, the
            evidence it came from, and the PHRASINGS that state it. A phrasing
            captures one number and carries an OFFSET, which is how an ordinal
            claim ("not a tenth technique") states a cardinal fact (count + 1).
  SITE      a page, optionally one section of it, that states that oracle.

Binding a second count is a SITE row and at most one oracle function. It is never
a second script.

BINDING, AND WHAT A ZERO MEANS. Every site reports how many claims it matched on
every run, and a site that matched ZERO is a FAILURE, not a pass (CLAUDE.md: a
green gate that binds to nothing is vacuous). A site goes to zero when every
sentence stating its count is reworded away — exactly when this gate would
otherwise go quietly dark over that page. Per-phrasing hit counts are printed
too, but a phrasing matching zero is NOT a failure: the phrasings are the
vocabulary for stating a count, not an assertion that this page uses each one,
and requiring every one to bind would mean the registry could only ever describe
the tree in front of it.

There is deliberately NO allowlist and no per-claim opt-out. An escape hatch here
would be satisfied by the very drift it exempts (CLAUDE.md, the sixth vacuity
mode: an opt-out must be secured by a property the defect cannot supply), so the
only ways to green are a true number or a page that does not state one.

STRUCTURAL CLAIMS. A document can also state a set by ENUMERATING it. `grammar.md`
§2c's table is the idiom index, so its rows are checked against the library's
`idiom-*` programs by SET, not by count: a program added to the library with no
row, or a row naming a program that does not exist, is a red no count comparison
would catch. It is also what stops that table serving as an oracle for the
technique count after it has quietly stopped describing the library.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. Every number in prose. Most counts in `docs/reference/`
are narrative measurements of one run ("28 of 63 roofed cells unreached") and
name no enumerable set; binding those would mean inventing an oracle per
sentence. The registry below is the counts that name a set the repo enumerates,
and it is grown by hand — a count nobody has registered is unbound, and this
script cannot tell you it exists. Nor does it bind a claim about a TOOL'S OUTPUT
to what the tool prints; that is the same class and is not yet built.

KNOWN UNBOUND, at the time this was written: `docs/reference/tools.md` and
`docs/reference/compiler.md` state the campaign's effect-root count as five and
as seven, while `EffectRootKind::ALL` carries eight. Three prose sites, one
oracle, all wrong — the same class, found by the survey that produced this
registry. It is not registered here because the phrase "N roots" appears in
~40 narrative sentences across the workspace and telling the claims from the
history needs the prose edit that fixes them, which belongs to whoever owns
those pages.

Deterministic, offline, stdlib-only. Exit 0 = pass, 1 = a finding.

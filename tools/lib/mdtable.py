"""Read a markdown pipe table the way the page that shows it is read.

## The defect this exists to end

Seven gates in `tools/` counted rows out of a markdown table, and every one of
them did it by matching a regular expression against lines — `startswith("|")`,
or a row pattern applied to the whole file, or to a section sliced at its
heading. None of them knew what a table was, so none of them could tell a row
inside one from a line of prose that happens to be full of pipe characters.

A blank line ends a pipe table. CommonMark's GFM table extension says a table
runs from its header row, through its delimiter row, to "the first empty line,
or beginning of another block-level structure" — so a row separated from its
table by one blank line renders as a paragraph of literal pipes, and every human
and every renderer sees it as prose. To those seven gates it was still a row.

That gap is not cosmetic, because those gates are what makes obligations bite.
A detached row still documented a diagnostic, still indexed a spec, still
declared what bounded a trial's verdict, still fenced a schema field — in the
letter, and for nobody who reads the page. Measured by perturbation on the live
documents: detaching the last row of its table left `check-dw-codes`,
`check-numbered-doc-index`, `check-trial-verdicts`, `check-grammar-ir-compat`,
`check-capability-ownership`, `check-stated-counts` and `check-reference-versions`
green, and pandoc's GFM reader drew the same row as a paragraph.

## Why one reader and not seven repairs

A general mechanism privately re-implemented at each site is the shape this
repository refuses by name: every proof and every diagnostic written for one
copy silently does not cover the others, and the copies drift. So the rule lives
here once, and a gate keeps its own row pattern and asks this module only the
question it cannot answer for itself — *is this line in a table at all*.

## What it implements, and where it stops

`read()` walks the document once and returns the body rows of every pipe table,
plus the lines that look like rows and belong to no table. A table is opened by
a header row directly above a delimiter row of the same cell count (both
conditions are the spec's; failing either means there is no table, which is why
a mistyped delimiter turns every row of a would-be table into an orphan rather
than into silence). It is closed by a blank line, by any block-level start, or
by the end of the document.

Fenced code is skipped, because a fence's contents are not markdown — a `|` in
a shell transcript is not a table row, and the reference documents are full of
them.

Not implemented, stated rather than assumed: indented (four-space) code blocks
are not recognised, so a pipe line indented four spaces is read as ordinary
text and, if it is not in a table, reported as an orphan. No document in this
repository does that, and the failure direction is a visible finding rather
than a silent pass.

# The Drowned Bell — generation log

Planner-authored souls campaign (M4 acceptance). Design brief: five-level
tidal keep, two loops (chapel shortcut + bell-rope hub fold), 初见杀 without
telegraphs, sightline-budgeted ambushes, optional dormant-leash elite,
timed portcullis, disable-able dart gallery, TD siege with an AND-join.
Authored against docs/notes/souls-design-language.md and the four owner
rulings recorded in spec-0016.

## Round 1 (2026-08-02)

- Stages 1–6 + zh-CN sidecar (107 keys, hand-written) + composed skins
  (ferrywoman/sexton, delve-skin, original, deterministic).
- Tileset: pool/tidal-keep (engine PR #168), six pieces, seed 17.
- `delvec validate` CLEAN after the schema round-trip (finale, radius,
  quest triggers, main_hand, l10n envelope, ASCII art titles per DW0328).
- `delvec build` currently RED on DW0210 at the gatehouse plate cell —
  the known light-model gap (trap triggers measured opaque; engine fix in
  review). No mitigation declared on purpose: the keep is lit, the
  measurement is wrong, and the fix belongs in the engine.
- Siege waves are plain waves this round; upgrade to TD raider lanes
  (`wave.lane`) when the primitive lands, before the delivery PR is final.
- Known deferred: elite dormancy staged via small follow_range leash
  (wave) rather than a posed actor — revisit if the campaign needs the
  Heide-Knight hunch visual; finite bonfire-refilled heals await the
  spec-0016 amendment batch (kits carry fixed stews meanwhile).

# The Drowned Bell r2 — prefab generation record

This campaign's prefabs are produced by the engine's prefab procedure
(`docs/reference/prefab-procedure.md` in the pipeline repo): scene description
first, palette by measurement, grammar program as JSON, machine gates at
expansion, render before believing, admission. The scene-type route table in
that document decides the back end; every zone below is a grammar zone.

## The programs are campaign files

`design/programs/z*.json` are the **artifacts of record** (ADR-0018: the IR is
the artifact; a zone belongs to its campaign, not to the engine's library).
Exported 2026-08-12 from the engine library `bell::` module at engine commit
`4be4a12` — the engine copies are slated for removal once this campaign's
pipeline consumes only these files. Vocabulary is inlined at export, so each
file is self-contained and expands via `delve-grammar expand --file`.

An expansion's provenance (program hash, region, seed) is recorded in the
metadata the expander writes beside every `.nbt`; the same inputs regenerate
the same bytes.

## Zone status

One prefab per zone (owner decision, 2026-08-12 — no candidate sweeps until
the zone set is complete).

| Zone | Concept | Program | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z0 barrow shore | `concept/z0-barrow-shore.jpg` | tidal-keep generator (pre-procedure; measured-palette pass 2026-08-11, engine PR #397) | owner-reviewed, accepted with the shoreline-edge correction applied |
| Z1 cliff road | `concept/z1-cliff-road.jpg` | `programs/z1-cliff-road.json` | **produced, awaiting owner review** — expands at 10x28x44; review set in `review/z1/` — see below |
| Z2 gate ward | `concept/z2-gatehouse.jpg` | `programs/z2-gate-ward.json` | **awaiting owner review** — expands at 20x10x84; interior review set in `review/z2/` (largest program: 101 rules) |
| Z3 drowned ward | `concept/z3-drowned-ward.jpg` | `programs/z3-drowned-ward.json` | program exported, unproduced |
| Z4 chapel ward | `concept/z4-chapel-ward.jpg` | `programs/z4-chapel-ward.json` | **produced, awaiting owner review** — see below |
| Z5 hall keep | `concept/z5-hall-keep.jpg` | `programs/z5-hall-keep.json` | program exported, unproduced |
| Z6 cistern deep | `concept/z6-cistern-deep.jpg` | `programs/z6-cistern-deep.json` | program exported, unproduced |
| Z7 bell tower | `concept/z7-bell-tower.jpg` | `programs/z7-bell-tower.json` | program exported, unproduced |

Zone order of production is by complexity, hardest first (owner decision,
2026-08-12): the most complex zone is produced and owner-reviewed before the
rest, so a workflow defect is found on the zone most likely to expose it.

## What checks these programs, and what it says today

`programs/zones.json` is the manifest: for each zone, which program file, at what
region and seed, claiming which optional gates. A program is region-polymorphic,
so without that file nothing knows what to expand — which is why the expansion
belonged in a manifest rather than in a sentence of this page.
`delve-grammar audit --campaign-root <content repo>` reads it, expands every zone
named there and judges it with the gates `expand` runs; both repos' CI run it.

**It is red, and what it reds on is the work each unproduced zone still owes.**
Two things stand between it and green, and both are per-zone:

- A program file carries `"version"` — the grammar document format it is written
  against — and the expander refuses a file without one.
  `programs/z1-cliff-road.json` declares `1.4.0`, the version that admits a paint
  written in the scope's own axis frame. The other seven carry no `version` field
  and do not load at all: `delve-grammar check --file <program>` refuses each
  with `missing field version` before anything is expanded.
- `zones.json` names Z1 only, so the audit reports the other seven as *a zone
  program nothing expands and nothing checks* — one line each, naming the file.

A zone joins the audit when it declares its version and takes its manifest row,
which is one step of producing it and not a separate chore.

## Z1 cliff road

**Scene** (fixed before any tool ran, per the procedure's §1): the player walks a
one-block ledge cut into a sea cliff, the rock wall close on the landward hand
and an open drop to the water on the seaward one, past shallow recesses in the
wall — some empty enough to stand back into, two holding the skull of somebody
who did not make the traverse.

**Expansion** — `delve-grammar expand --file design/programs/z1-cliff-road.json
--region 10x28x44 --seed 1 --traversable --reachable-floor`. Every gate passes
with a non-zero binding: `blocks-exist` 7, `shape-complete` 7, `states-complete`
7, `oriented-fills` 27, `non-empty` 12320, `traversable` 3, `reachable-floor` 6.
5490 filled cells, 7 distinct states, 50 standable cells all reachable on foot,
12 anchors, silhouette complexity 1.65. `delve-admit audit` passes over 12320
blocks (0 forbidden, 0 non-allowlisted, 0 unknown, 0 under-specified).

**Provenance** — program
`sha256:67c441bc329fdd1517740c8d6fe8c765ed885b9ee11f4f4e52672894a71ad2fb`, seed
1, region 10x28x44; re-expanding those inputs reproduces the `.nbt`, the metadata
and the report byte for byte. The program hash is taken over the *effective*
program — parameter and role overrides applied — so a piece is reproduced from
the hash the metadata names rather than from the file plus a remembered command
line. Both of this zone's shipped values (`fall` 12, `sea` 5) live in the
program's own `params` for that reason.

**Artifacts** — `prefabs/z1-cliff-road.nbt` + `prefabs/z1-cliff-road.json`;
review shots and what each camera did in `design/review/z1/`.

**Palette** — measured, never named from memory. Material colours are patch means
over crops of the concept image, verified by looking at the crops drawn back onto
the image; candidates come from `tools/block-appearance.py --screen` over the
measured shelf, and the mixes were read as a swatch sheet before binding. The
near cliff measures as a near-neutral dark grey of very wide value range (mean
`#3f3e3a`, luminance p05 30 and p95 101 out of 255, saturation 6/255), which is a
*mix* rather than a block: bound to one block the wall reads as a flat panel that
no measurement of the mean would object to.

| Role | Mix | Measured | Concept sample |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crag` | `cobbled_deepslate` 50% · `smooth_basalt` 30% · `blackstone` 10% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 10% | `#49484d` | `#3f3e3a` near cliff face — the untouched sea-cliff mass below and behind the road |
| `path/rock` | `cobbled_deepslate` 60% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 20% · `tuff` 10% · `blackstone` 10% | `#4e4e50` | `#464742` the cut ledge and its wall — same rock, a shade lighter and drier where it is worked |
| `path/corpse` | `skeleton_skull[powered=false,rotation=8]` | — | the remains in the wall recesses |

`blackstone` is the loud member of both mixes and holds 10% of the area, which is
the craft rule the numbers serve; the near-black patches are the concept's deep
crevices. `deepslate[axis=y]` carries the vertical grain the cliff face is
striated with.

**Every role is written in the scope's own axis frame.** The palette's three
entries are `{"local": …}` paints, so each resolves its directions through the
scope that fills it: `deepslate`'s `axis` and the skull's `rotation` follow the
piece instead of the world. This is not decoration. The recesses are reached
through a `reorient` that names the across-path axis as local `Z`, so the corpse
is authored as `rotation=8` — facing out of its own recess — and the expander
writes `rotation=4` into the world. Written bare, the same value is the world's
own yaw: the skull would face along the road into the side wall of its recess,
and every gate would still be green. 27 of 27 orientation-carrying fills resolve
this way.

**Open against this piece**

- Lighting profile is `dark` (`DW0751`, min light 0 over the 4 roofed walkable
  cells). The road itself is open to the sky; the dark cells are the recesses,
  and no rule in this zone exposes a light-emitting role, so a lantern in a
  recess arrives as campaign-bound content on the declared anchors.
- **The ledge does not overhang, and the program cannot make it.** The concept's
  road projects from the cliff on a lip with the drop undercut beneath it; here
  the walking surface is flush with the rock below, so the seaward elevation is a
  flat plane with a seam. The one lever is `ledge_shelf`, which lays its course
  across the *whole* gulf width, so the lip's projection and the drop's width are
  the same number: `sea=3` gives 182 standable cells and `sea=5` gives 269,
  against 50 shipped, and `sea=2` is refused by `road_plan`'s own guard. A narrow
  lip over a wide drop is not expressible, and the zone ships at `ledge_shelf=0`
  — a one-block ledge, which is the exposure the scene is about.
- The concept's rusted iron stanchions and their chain rail have no role and no
  rule in this program. They are the element that reads the road as *made* rather
  than found, and adding them is design work this production did not do.
- The piece declares no spatial contract, so every contract obligation examined
  nothing and `traversable`'s binding counts standable cells on two region faces
  rather than declared ways in.
- Judge it from the eye shots. A cliff section is solid rock with a groove in it,
  so its exterior orbit cameras photograph a slab and cannot show the road at
  all; `review/z1/README.md` says which camera answers which question.

## Z4 chapel ward

**Scene** (fixed before any tool ran, per the procedure's §1): the player drops
out of the keep's kitchen duct onto the floor of a walled chapel ward of pale
grey-green ashlar, steps aside into a low paved nook to rest, and walks the
lane out past a side doorway — behind which a barred grate holds the sealed half
of a shortcut that only opens from the far side.

**Expansion** — `delve-grammar expand --file design/programs/z4-chapel-ward.json
--region 16x9x26 --seed 1 --traversable --allow-falls`. All gates pass with
non-zero bindings: `blocks-exist` 7, `non-empty` 3744, `traversable` 10 (5
standable cells at the approach end, 5 at the exit end, 165 in all; the entry is
a fall, hence `--allow-falls`). 3045 filled cells, 7 distinct states, 6 anchors,
silhouette complexity 1.03. `delve-admit audit` passes (0 forbidden, 0
non-allowlisted, 0 unknown).

**Provenance** — program `sha256:eb6b39ddd66c20ff4657767635a91269118b8d6cd494090988d7b90571435540`,
seed 1, region 16x9x26; re-expanding those inputs reproduces the `.nbt` byte for
byte (verified: `sha256:ac11c68d2eb97eca5f5218fbeb11df9dbb9a49eefb4bdfaaed0b8f67aecf6019`).
It is recorded here as well as in the metadata because `delve-admit lighting
--write` rewrites the metadata without the machine-readable `license.generated_by`
block.

**Artifacts** — `prefabs/z4-chapel-ward.nbt` + `prefabs/z4-chapel-ward.json`
(the repo's flat prefab library, where every other campaign's pieces live);
review shots in `design/review/z4/`.

**Palette** — measured, never named from memory: material colours sampled from
the concept image (patch means over verified crops), then blocks taken from
`tools/block-appearance.py --near` ranked lists, full-cube for everything
structural.

| Role | Block | Measured | Concept sample |
|---|---|---|---|
| `junction/rock` | `minecraft:tuff_bricks` | `#62675f` | `#626863` lit arcade ashlar |
| `hearth/rock` | `minecraft:tuff_bricks` | `#62675f` | `#626863` — same stone as the junction, so the lane reads as one building |
| `shortcut/rock` | `minecraft:polished_tuff` | `#626864` | `#5c6160` far-wall arch stone; smooth, for the plainer sealed chamber |
| `chute/rock` | `minecraft:cobbled_deepslate` | `#4d4d51` | `#4f554b` shadowed lower masonry — the service duct is not the ward |
| `hearth/hearth_floor` | `minecraft:polished_andesite` | `#848786` | `#7b8789` lit flagstone — the rest plate |
| `margin` | `minecraft:deepslate` | `#545456` | inert mass, no player-visible face |
| `shortcut/bar` | `minecraft:iron_bars` | `#898b88` | `#262e31` door ironwork |

The bar is the one deliberate departure from the nearest colour match. The
concept's barrier is a timber door leaf, but the rule seals a 6-wide by 3-high
partition opening, which is a portcullis and not a leaf; a see-through grate is
also what lets the player read the far side of a shortcut before it opens.

**Open against this piece**

- Lighting profile is `dark` (`DW0751`, min floor light 0 over 165 walkable
  cells). No rule in this zone exposes a light-emitting role, so the piece
  cannot be lit from its palette: light has to arrive as campaign-bound content
  on the declared anchors, or as a light role added to the library rules.
- The concept image is an open, roofless cloister; the zone's design intent and
  topology are an enclosed hub. The palette and proportions converge on the
  concept's material and tone, and the composition does not — deliberately, the
  topology is fixed.
- 47.9% of the piece is `margin`, the inert mass behind the shortcut rooms.

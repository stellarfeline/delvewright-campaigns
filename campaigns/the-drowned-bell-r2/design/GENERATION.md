# The Drowned Bell r2 — prefab generation record

This campaign's prefabs are produced by the engine's prefab procedure
(`docs/reference/prefab-procedure.md` in the pipeline repo): scene description
first, palette by measurement, grammar program as JSON, machine gates at
expansion, render before believing, admission. The scene-type route table in
that document decides the back end; every zone below is a grammar zone.

## The programs are campaign files

`design/programs/z*.json` are the **artifacts of record** (ADR-0018: the IR is
the artifact; a zone belongs to its campaign, not to the engine's library).
Exported 2026-08-12 from the engine library `bell::` module at engine commit
`4be4a12` — the engine copies are slated for removal once this campaign's
pipeline consumes only these files. Vocabulary is inlined at export, so each
file is self-contained and expands via `delve-grammar expand --file`.

`programs/zones.json` says at what size and seed this campaign builds each of
them, and which optional gates each zone claims. Without it a program file
cannot be expanded at all — a grammar program fits any region, so nothing but
the campaign knows which one is this zone. It is a bijection with the directory:
a program file it does not name is a finding, and so is an entry naming a file
that is not there.

`delve-grammar audit --campaign-root <this repo>` expands every zone declared
here and runs every machine gate over it, stating what each gate examined. CI
runs it on every pull request and every push, and the pipeline repo runs the
same command against its pinned copy of this repo.

An expansion's provenance (program hash, region, seed) is recorded in the
metadata the expander writes beside every `.nbt`; the same inputs regenerate
the same bytes. The hash is taken over the **effective** program — parameters
and role overrides applied — so it identifies what was expanded rather than what
the file said before the command line touched it, and a zone whose shipped values
live in its own `params` needs no remembered flags to be reproduced.

**Seven of the eight zones pass every gate; Z3 does not.** `fluid-contained` reds
on the drowned ward with `DW0800`: 380 ways out of a 2304-cell body of water, so
the ward renders as still water in every tool here and runs on the first tick in
the world. It reproduces from Z3's program alone, in a corpus holding nothing
else, and it is a *design* answer — where the ward's water is walled and where it
is meant to spill — not a palette or a version matter.

## An oriented block state is a palette role, written in the scope's own frame

A connection, facing or rotation property names a direction, and a direction is
only meaningful against a frame. Written bare, a state is in the **world** frame
and a reorientation does not rewrite it — so a bar or a skull bound to a plain
role lands turned however the scope was turned, and the piece ships facing the
wrong way with every gate green. Wrapped as `{"local": …}` the state is in the
**scope's own** frame and is resolved into the world's at fill time, which is
what lets an orientation-dependent block stay a role a campaign can restyle
without knowing which way the piece was laid.

Every such role in this campaign is written that way, so no zone is held back by
it: all eight pass `oriented-fills`, six of them carry local roles, and the audit
totals **193** fills resolved out of a scope's own frame across those six.
Z1 is the worked case, and it shows why the frame is not decoration: the corpse
is authored as `rotation=8`, facing out of its own recess, and lands in the world
as `rotation=4`.

Z0 is the other kind of case, and it is the one a green hides. Its root asks for
`z: largest` over a box already longest along Z, so the frame it stands in is the
**identity** — and a world-frame literal under an identity frame is not judged at
all, which is a different fact from being judged and found sound. The engine now
splits those two with a third verdict, *this region cannot decide it*, and the
way not to depend on which one a green means is to write the state in the scope's
own frame in the first place.

Two shapes the frame cannot resolve, and both are refusals rather than guesses: a
16-step `rotation` and a handedness are stated against a fixed vertical *and* a
fixed handedness, so under anything but a pure turn about the vertical they have
no image (`DW0738`); and a state written bare under a turned frame is refused
outright (`DW0736`).

## Zone status

One prefab per zone (owner decision, 2026-08-12 — no candidate sweeps until
the zone set is complete).

| Zone | Concept | Program | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z0 barrow shore | `concept/z0-barrow-shore.jpg` | `programs/z0-barrow-shore.json` | **produced, awaiting owner review** — expands at 40x18x80 as a 2-tile set; review set in `review/z0/` — see below |
| Z1 cliff road | `concept/z1-cliff-road.jpg` | `programs/z1-cliff-road.json` | **produced, awaiting owner review** — expands at 10x28x44; review set in `review/z1/` — see below |
| Z2 gate ward | `concept/z2-gatehouse.jpg` | `programs/z2-gate-ward.json` | **awaiting owner review** — expands at 20x10x84; interior review set in `review/z2/` (largest program: 101 rules) |
| Z3 drowned ward | `concept/z3-drowned-ward.jpg` | `programs/z3-drowned-ward.json` | program exported, unproduced |
| Z4 chapel ward | `concept/z4-chapel-ward.jpg` | `programs/z4-chapel-ward.json` | **produced, awaiting owner review** — see below |
| Z5 hall keep | `concept/z5-hall-keep.jpg` | `programs/z5-hall-keep.json` | program exported, unproduced |
| Z6 cistern deep | `concept/z6-cistern-deep.jpg` | `programs/z6-cistern-deep.json` | program exported, unproduced |
| Z7 bell tower | `concept/z7-bell-tower.jpg` | `programs/z7-bell-tower.json` | program exported, unproduced |

Zone order of production is by complexity, hardest first (owner decision,
2026-08-12): the most complex zone is produced and owner-reviewed before the
rest, so a workflow defect is found on the zone most likely to expose it.

## Z0 barrow shore

**Scene** (fixed before any tool ran, per the procedure's §1): the player wakes
face-down on a causeway of wet grey sand running north across a half-mile of
tidal flat, walks up through a line of three rusted stakes into a field of
drystone graves that thins as the ground rises inland, and reaches a shelf of
worked stone under the rock's foot where a lamp is burning in daylight and one
cut ledge starts up the cliff. Below the stake line the ground drops a course
into soft dark mire, which the sea covers at every state of the tide but the
lowest.

### Every beat, and the rule that builds it

`beats.md` is what this zone must stage. A beat with no rule beside it is absent,
and none is.

| # | beat | rule(s) that build it | anchors |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | wakes face-down on wet flat, a heap of stones a few metres away | `causeway/spine` → `causeway/wake_row` → `causeway/wake_post`; the heaps it wakes among are `mud/plan` → `mud/cairn_row` → `mud/mound`, and the nearest is 7 blocks up-causeway | `wake` (north) |
| 0.2 | the cairn field, readable, thinning inland | `cairn/field` → `cairn/row` → `cairn/mound` → `cairn/heap` → `cairn/inset_x` / `cairn/inset_z`; `flat/inner` and `flat/outer` call the one field rule under a `bind` that rebinds `cairn/gap` and `cairn/row_gap`, and that binding **is** the density gradient. The three readable graves are `cairn/grave_row` → `cairn/grave` | `grave-1..3` (north) |
| 0.3 | first enemy pushes up out of the mud beside a cairn, walking landward | `flat/outer` → `flat/first_row` → `flat/answered_post`, one cell east of a `cairn/mound` on the last row of flat before the line | `first-answered` (north, i.e. landward) |
| 0.4 | K1 the tide-stakes: three iron posts, lethal outside the line | `stake/band` → `stake/line` → `stake/post` for the posts; the boundary itself is `ground/flat` meeting `ground/mire` — one course down and a visibly different paint — and the graves crowding it are `cairn/grave_row` plus `cairn/row` under a tighter `bind` | `stake-1..3` (north), and `mire-1..2` for the hazard box |
| 0.5 | Emeric on the last dry shelf, shore-lamp lit in full daylight | `cliff/shelf_lane` → `shelf/plate` → `shelf/furnish` → `shelf/stand` for the standing cell, `shelf/front_wall` → `shelf/wall_course` for the low walling and `shelf/lamp_cell` for the lamp on it | `lampman` (south) |
| 0.6 | the flat ends at a wall of cliff; one cut ledge starts up it | `cliff/band` → `cliff/crag` → `cliff/crag_face` → `cliff/batter` for the face, `cliff/cut` → `ledge/start` → `ledge/run` and `ledge/foot_tread` for the ledge | `ledge-foot` (north) |
| 0.7 | the Dead Ebb return: the answered standing in the silt, facing the rock | `mud/band` → `mud/field` → `mud/plan` → `mud/figure_field` → `mud/figure_row` → `mud/figure_post`, on `ground/mire` a course below the flat | `silt-1..24` (north, i.e. facing the rock) |

**7 of 7 built.** Beats 0.4 and 0.7 are built as far as a grammar program reaches
— the ground, the boundary and the positions — and each needs one campaign-level
declaration to finish: a hazard on `anchor/mire-1..2`, and bodies on
`anchor/silt-*`. Neither is geometry and neither is expressible here.

**Expansion** — `delve-grammar expand --file design/programs/z0-barrow-shore.json
--region 40x18x80 --seed 1 --traversable --id z0-barrow-shore -o out/`. Every
gate passes with a non-zero binding: `blocks-exist` 12, `shape-complete` 12,
`states-complete` 12, `oriented-fills` 383, `non-empty` 57600, `traversable` 44.
19 067 filled cells of 57 600, 12 distinct states (11 of them not air), 2854
standable cells, footprint 3200 columns, perimeter 240, silhouette complexity
1.06, 37 anchors. Reachability: 2764 of 2854 standable cells reached on foot from
135 grade entry cells; **0 sheltered**, so the piece is open to the sky end to
end, and the 90 unreached cells are the crag's own batter ledges and the tops of
the three stakes — floor open to the sky, which the report states as a number and
never as a finding. `delve-admit audit` passes over 57 600 blocks (0 forbidden, 0
non-allowlisted, 0 unknown, 0 pre-pin unknown, 0 under-specified, 0 findings),
with a per-tile verdict for both tiles.

**Provenance** — program
`sha256:be06fc468d1b5fafa15bba95a649cdaa96d3e93d46cf1249ca312c88363b17c9`, seed
1, region 40x18x80. Every tuned value lives in the program's own `params`, so the
file plus the manifest row is the whole recipe and no remembered flag is part of
it.

Reproduction was taken from a **second instrument**: a separate worktree at the
same engine commit, its own cargo target tree, its own working directory and its
own output directory. Three methods, none of which hashes a file path — `cmp`
over the bytes, `shasum` fed from **stdin** so no name reaches the digest, and a
cell-by-cell diff through a structure-template reader written for the check
rather than by the expander. 3 of 3 files identical, 57 600 of 57 600 cells
equal, 0 differing, 37 anchors identical, program hash equal. The two release
builds of the pinned commit are themselves byte-identical.

**Artifacts** — `prefabs/z0-barrow-shore.x0y0z0.nbt`,
`prefabs/z0-barrow-shore.x0y0z1.nbt` and `prefabs/z0-barrow-shore.json` in the
repo's flat prefab library. The zone is past the 48-per-axis structure-template
cap on its long axis, so it ships as a tile set in a 1×1×2 grid and **the
manifest is the only file that describes the zone**: the gates, the render and
the admission audit all take it and treat the tiles as one thing. Review shots and
what each camera answers: `design/review/z0/`.

**Palette** — measured, never named from memory. Material colours are patch means
over crops of the concept image, verified by drawing the crops back onto it and
looking; candidates come from `tools/block-appearance.py --near` over the measured
shelf, and every mix was read as a render before it was believed.

| Role | Mix | Measured | Concept sample |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shore/sand` | `cobbled_deepslate` 30% · `mud` 22% · `tuff` 20% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 18% · `blackstone` 10% | `#4d4c4e` | `#545c60` the open wet flat mid-frame; p05 51, p95 128 out of 255, so a **mix** and not a block — bound to one block the flat reads as a floor |
| `shore/silt` | `mud` 55% · `cobbled_deepslate` 20% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 15% · `blackstone` 10% | `#413f43` | `#4b5254` the nearer, wetter flat. Held against `shore/sand` it is the whole of beat 0.4's tell: the ground below the line is a different colour, at every tide and from any distance |
| `cairn/stone` | `cobblestone` 42% · `andesite` 18% · `cobbled_deepslate` 18% · `blackstone` 12% · `mossy_cobblestone` 10% | `#6c6c6b` | `#3e4444` the big foreground-left cairn, p95 128 — pale rounded stones in a dark matrix, which is a mix and not a mean |
| `cliff/rock` | `cobbled_deepslate` 50% · `smooth_basalt` 30% · `blackstone` 10% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 10% | `#49484d` | `#3c4348` the near cliff face. **Z1's `crag`, unchanged** — Z0's crag and Z1's cliff are the same rock, and two mixes would put a seam in it |
| `ledge/rock` | `cobbled_deepslate` 60% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 20% · `tuff` 10% · `blackstone` 10% | `#4e4e50` | Z1's `path/rock`, unchanged, for the same reason: the cut ledge here is the road there |
| `shelf/stone` | `cobblestone` 48% · `tuff` 22% · `cobbled_deepslate` 20% · `mossy_cobblestone` 10% | `#70706e` | `#3b3f3e` the drystone walling right of frame — the same family as the graves, a shade lighter where it is worked |
| `shore/bed` | `cobbled_deepslate` | `#4d4d51` | inert mass under every surface; no player-visible face except the region's own sides |
| `stake/iron` | `dark_oak_fence` | `#432b14` | `#201b16` the right-hand post, saturation 10.8 — warm and very dark |
| `shelf/lamp` | `lantern[hanging=false,waterlogged=false]` | `#6b5c55` | the shore-lamp |

Every mix's loudest chromatic member sits at 10% of area or less, which is the
craft rule the numbers serve. **The binding is 9 of 9 roles**, and it had to be
taken a role at a time with `--mix`: `block-appearance.py --program` reads a
paint only when it is a string or a list, so a paint written in the scope's own
axis frame is a `dict` and is skipped by both arms in silence. Pointed at this
program it prints `binding: 4 paint(s) examined` over a program that declares
nine, having missed all five local ones — including `cliff/rock` and
`shore/sand`, which write 50.3% of the zone's blocks between them. The line reads
as a pass.

**What each role actually writes**, measured rather than inferred from the block
census: the two are different questions, since one block serves several roles.
Each role was rebound to a marker block in turn and the marker counted off the
expansion, which moves no geometry — and the nine come to 19 067 cells exactly,
i.e. they partition the filled zone, which is the check that the method is
reading what it thinks it is.

| Role | cells | share of filled |
|---|---|---|
| `cliff/rock` | 7446 | 39.1% |
| `shore/bed` | 7430 | 39.0% |
| `shore/sand` | 2150 | 11.3% |
| `cairn/stone` | 997 | 5.2% |
| `shore/silt` | 490 | 2.6% |
| `ledge/rock` | 328 | 1.7% |
| `shelf/stone` | 216 | 1.1% |
| `stake/iron` | 9 | 0.05% |
| `shelf/lamp` | 1 | 0.01% |

Two substitutions, both deliberate and neither a colour match:

- **The stakes are a fence, not iron.** Vanilla has no thin rusted-iron post.
  What carries "iron stake" at played scale is the silhouette — a 4/16 post reads
  as a stake where a full block reads as a pillar — plus the measured warm-dark
  value against the flat's cool grey. `iron_bars` is the right material and the
  wrong colour (`#898b88`, lighter than the ground it stands in); `dark_oak_fence`
  is the right colour and the wrong material, and the silhouette is the half that
  survives at 1 m per block.
- **The black weed is the dark member of the ground and cairn mixes, not a block
  of its own.** `dried_kelp_block` is the thematically exact choice and its mean
  (`#2e3724`) is almost the concept's weed (`#2e3234`) — and it renders as
  saturated green with cream borders, loud at 10% of area across a whole flat.
  `sculk` was tried next and renders as bright cyan speckle. Both were caught by
  looking, not by measuring; a mean cannot see a texture. `blackstone` is what the
  weed reads as at played scale: a near-black smear on grey.

**Every orientation-carrying role is written in the scope's own axis frame.** Five
of the nine roles are `{"local": …}` paints and 160 of the 161 fills that carry
block-state properties resolve through the scope that filled them; the one that
does not is the lantern, whose two properties name no direction. That matters
here for a reason this zone would otherwise have hidden: its root asks for
`z: largest` and its box is already longest along Z, so **the frame is the
identity and a world-frame literal would have passed every gate at this region
and landed wrong at any other**. Checked rather than assumed — the same program
was expanded at an engine carrying the third verdict for that gate, which reports
`this region cannot decide it` exactly where a green means "never judged", and
`oriented-fills` comes back `pass` and not `undecided`. The two engines produce
byte-identical output over all 57 600 cells.

**The fog band, and what closes the shore.** Beyond the played flat the shore is
closed by fiction, not by a gradient, and neither half of it is geometry:

- a **`boundary`** declaration (`{margin, message}`) derives the playable region
  from the placed pieces and runs a 1 s clock that returns a player outside it to
  the last checkpoint with an actionbar line and a soft sound, taking no damage
  and no item. The line is the narration hook and is already inventoried for
  translation as `world.boundary.message`;
- a **`give-effect`** with an `in` box centred on an anchor is the fog itself — a
  status effect scoped to a coordinate box, the same box model a stealth zone and
  a lethal volume use.

The zone's part is to make the band mean something rather than merely hide a
wall. `anchor/crossing` sits on the causeway's own mouth at the region's south
face, facing south, and it is the cell the narration binds to: what lies that way
is the crossing, which the player has already made. `map-brief.md` fixes the
words. The anchor renders as an empty frame and is kept in the review set for
that — it faces out of the piece, which is exactly what it is for.

**Open against this piece**

- **The piece declares no spatial contract**, so every contract obligation
  examined nothing, and `traversable`'s binding of 44 counts standable cells on
  two faces of the region rather than declared ways in. The zone has four real
  ones — the causeway's mouth south, the ledge north, and the open flat running
  off east and west into the fog — and stating them would turn that 44 into 4
  doors and put the mire, the shelf and the ledge into named spaces with proven
  edges between them. It is the largest single thing still owed here.
- **The crag's batter is regular.** The face steps back one cell every three
  courses, which makes it a cliff rather than a staircase (a one-course riser
  would be a step, and the way on would stop being the only way on) and gives the
  silhouette the receding ledges the concept's cliffs have. What it cannot do is
  vary: the language has no positional index, so every bay of the face steps at
  the same height, and the concept's face does not.
- **`delve-admit lighting` cannot measure a tiled zone, and does not say so.**
  Handed the manifest it fails with `DW0732 gzip decode: invalid gzip header`,
  having tried to read the JSON as NBT. Handed one tile of the set it returns a
  verdict — `profile: dark`, 1574 floor cells, min light 0 — over 48 of the zone's
  80 blocks of length, i.e. 1574 of its 2854 standable cells, with no indication
  that it is looking at half a zone. `delve-admit audit` refuses that same lone
  tile by name and points at the manifest, and so does `delve-render`; the guard
  exists in two of the three doors. So no lighting profile was written, and the
  metadata still says `"profile": "unmeasured"`, which is a positive statement
  that a measurement is owed rather than a missing field.
- **The number would be wrong here in a second way even if it could be taken.**
  The probe measures block light, and this zone is open to the sky over all 2854
  of its standable cells; the one light it carries is Emeric's lamp. An open
  beach at noon reports `dark`.
- **A mire that is lethal at one tide and safe at another is not a
  `lethal_volumes[]`.** That surface has no state gate, so a volume declared over
  the mire would kill the answered standing in it at the Dead Ebb — and
  `DW0511` forbids posting a body inside one, which is exactly what
  `anchor/silt-*` does. The expressible form is a `trigger` carrying
  `damage-players {amount, in: {anchor: mire-<i>, extent}}` under `requires_state`
  on the tide, which is gateable at all 35 sites. Recorded because the obvious
  reading of beat 0.4 reaches for the wrong verb.
- **Mass the player never touches is 78.0% of the zone.** `shore/bed` is 39.0%
  — the courses under every surface, with no visible face but the region's own
  sides — and `cliff/rock` is 39.1%, nearly all of it solid rock behind a face
  seen only from the south. Both are doing work beat 0.6 asks for, and both are
  still mass nobody walks in; the eight roles a player can actually see total
  22.0%. So when the §4 palette budget lands as a diagnostic, this zone's claim
  has to be scoped to reachable mass or it will be a judgement about the inside
  of a cliff — the same risk `grammar.md` §5c records for Z6's margin, at twice
  the share.
- **The shore is drawn against `reference/map-brief.md`, which is not on this
  branch.** So is `beat-audit.md`, the document that found this zone staged none
  of its beats. Both were read from their own branches.

## Z1 cliff road

**Scene** (fixed before any tool ran, per the procedure's §1): the player walks a
one-block ledge cut into a sea cliff, the rock wall close on the landward hand
and an open drop to the water on the seaward one, past shallow recesses in the
wall — some empty enough to stand back into, two holding the skull of somebody
who did not make the traverse.

**Expansion** — `delve-grammar expand --file design/programs/z1-cliff-road.json
--region 10x28x44 --seed 1 --traversable --reachable-floor`. Every gate passes
with a non-zero binding: `blocks-exist` 7, `shape-complete` 7, `states-complete`
7, `oriented-fills` 27, `non-empty` 12320, `traversable` 3, `reachable-floor` 6.
5490 filled cells, 7 distinct states, 50 standable cells all reachable on foot,
12 anchors, silhouette complexity 1.65. `delve-admit audit` passes over 12320
blocks (0 forbidden, 0 non-allowlisted, 0 unknown, 0 under-specified).

**Provenance** — program
`sha256:67c441bc329fdd1517740c8d6fe8c765ed885b9ee11f4f4e52672894a71ad2fb`, seed
1, region 10x28x44; re-expanding those inputs reproduces the `.nbt`, the metadata
and the report byte for byte. Both of this zone's tuned values — `fall` 12 and
`sea` 5, a drop that reads as lethal and a gulf wide enough to see down — live in
the program's own `params`, so the file plus the manifest row is the whole recipe.

**Artifacts** — `prefabs/z1-cliff-road.nbt` + `prefabs/z1-cliff-road.json`;
review shots and what each camera did in `design/review/z1/`.

**Palette** — measured, never named from memory. Material colours are patch means
over crops of the concept image, verified by looking at the crops drawn back onto
the image; candidates come from `tools/block-appearance.py --screen` over the
measured shelf, and the mixes were read as a swatch sheet before binding. The
near cliff measures as a near-neutral dark grey of very wide value range (mean
`#3f3e3a`, luminance p05 30 and p95 101 out of 255, saturation 6/255), which is a
*mix* rather than a block: bound to one block the wall reads as a flat panel that
no measurement of the mean would object to.

| Role | Mix | Measured | Concept sample |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crag` | `cobbled_deepslate` 50% · `smooth_basalt` 30% · `blackstone` 10% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 10% | `#49484d` | `#3f3e3a` near cliff face — the untouched sea-cliff mass below and behind the road |
| `path/rock` | `cobbled_deepslate` 60% · `deepslate[axis=y]` 20% · `tuff` 10% · `blackstone` 10% | `#4e4e50` | `#464742` the cut ledge and its wall — same rock, a shade lighter and drier where it is worked |
| `path/corpse` | `skeleton_skull[powered=false,rotation=8]` | — | the remains in the wall recesses |

`blackstone` is the loud member of both mixes and holds 10% of the area, which is
the craft rule the numbers serve; the near-black patches are the concept's deep
crevices. `deepslate[axis=y]` carries the vertical grain the cliff face is
striated with.

**Every role is written in the scope's own axis frame.** The palette's three
entries are `{"local": …}` paints, so each resolves its directions through the
scope that fills it: `deepslate`'s `axis` and the skull's `rotation` follow the
piece instead of the world. This is not decoration. The recesses are reached
through a `reorient` that names the across-path axis as local `Z`, so the corpse
is authored as `rotation=8` — facing out of its own recess — and the expander
writes `rotation=4` into the world. Written bare, the same value is the world's
own yaw: the skull would face along the road into the side wall of its recess,
and every gate would still be green. 27 of 27 orientation-carrying fills resolve
this way.

**Open against this piece**

- Lighting profile is `dark` (`DW0751`, min light 0 over the 4 roofed walkable
  cells). The road itself is open to the sky; the dark cells are the recesses,
  and no rule in this zone exposes a light-emitting role, so a lantern in a
  recess arrives as campaign-bound content on the declared anchors.
- **The ledge does not overhang, and the program cannot make it.** The concept's
  road projects from the cliff on a lip with the drop undercut beneath it; here
  the walking surface is flush with the rock below, so the seaward elevation is a
  flat plane with a seam. The one lever is `ledge_shelf`, which lays its course
  across the *whole* gulf width, so the lip's projection and the drop's width are
  the same number: `sea=3` gives 182 standable cells and `sea=5` gives 269,
  against 50 shipped, and `sea=2` is refused by `road_plan`'s own guard. A narrow
  lip over a wide drop is not expressible, and the zone ships at `ledge_shelf=0`
  — a one-block ledge, which is the exposure the scene is about.
- The concept's rusted iron stanchions and their chain rail have no role and no
  rule in this program. They are the element that reads the road as *made* rather
  than found, and adding them is design work this production did not do.
- The piece declares no spatial contract, so every contract obligation examined
  nothing and `traversable`'s binding counts standable cells on two region faces
  rather than declared ways in.
- Judge it from the eye shots. A cliff section is solid rock with a groove in it,
  so its exterior orbit cameras photograph a slab and cannot show the road at
  all; `review/z1/README.md` says which camera answers which question.

## Z4 chapel ward

**Scene** (fixed before any tool ran, per the procedure's §1): the player drops
out of the keep's kitchen duct onto the floor of a walled chapel ward of pale
grey-green ashlar, steps aside into a low paved nook to rest, and walks the
lane out past a side doorway — behind which a barred grate holds the sealed half
of a shortcut that only opens from the far side.

**Expansion** — `delve-grammar expand --file design/programs/z4-chapel-ward.json
--region 16x9x26 --seed 1 --traversable --allow-falls`. All gates pass with
non-zero bindings: `blocks-exist` 7, `non-empty` 3744, `traversable` 10 (5
standable cells at the approach end, 5 at the exit end, 165 in all; the entry is
a fall, hence `--allow-falls`). 3045 filled cells, 7 distinct states, 6 anchors,
silhouette complexity 1.03. `delve-admit audit` passes (0 forbidden, 0
non-allowlisted, 0 unknown).

**Provenance** — program `sha256:eb6b39ddd66c20ff4657767635a91269118b8d6cd494090988d7b90571435540`,
seed 1, region 16x9x26; re-expanding those inputs reproduces the `.nbt` byte for
byte (verified: `sha256:ac11c68d2eb97eca5f5218fbeb11df9dbb9a49eefb4bdfaaed0b8f67aecf6019`).
It is recorded here as well as in the metadata because `delve-admit lighting
--write` rewrites the metadata without the machine-readable `license.generated_by`
block.

**Artifacts** — `prefabs/z4-chapel-ward.nbt` + `prefabs/z4-chapel-ward.json`
(the repo's flat prefab library, where every other campaign's pieces live);
review shots in `design/review/z4/`.

**Palette** — measured, never named from memory: material colours sampled from
the concept image (patch means over verified crops), then blocks taken from
`tools/block-appearance.py --near` ranked lists, full-cube for everything
structural.

| Role | Block | Measured | Concept sample |
|---|---|---|---|
| `junction/rock` | `minecraft:tuff_bricks` | `#62675f` | `#626863` lit arcade ashlar |
| `hearth/rock` | `minecraft:tuff_bricks` | `#62675f` | `#626863` — same stone as the junction, so the lane reads as one building |
| `shortcut/rock` | `minecraft:polished_tuff` | `#626864` | `#5c6160` far-wall arch stone; smooth, for the plainer sealed chamber |
| `chute/rock` | `minecraft:cobbled_deepslate` | `#4d4d51` | `#4f554b` shadowed lower masonry — the service duct is not the ward |
| `hearth/hearth_floor` | `minecraft:polished_andesite` | `#848786` | `#7b8789` lit flagstone — the rest plate |
| `margin` | `minecraft:deepslate` | `#545456` | inert mass, no player-visible face |
| `shortcut/bar` | `minecraft:iron_bars` | `#898b88` | `#262e31` door ironwork |

The bar is the one deliberate departure from the nearest colour match. The
concept's barrier is a timber door leaf, but the rule seals a 6-wide by 3-high
partition opening, which is a portcullis and not a leaf; a see-through grate is
also what lets the player read the far side of a shortcut before it opens.

**Open against this piece**

- Lighting profile is `dark` (`DW0751`, min floor light 0 over 165 walkable
  cells). No rule in this zone exposes a light-emitting role, so the piece
  cannot be lit from its palette: light has to arrive as campaign-bound content
  on the declared anchors, or as a light role added to the library rules.
- The concept image is an open, roofless cloister; the zone's design intent and
  topology are an enclosed hub. The palette and proportions converge on the
  concept's material and tone, and the composition does not — deliberately, the
  topology is fixed.
- 47.9% of the piece is `margin`, the inert mass behind the shortcut rooms.
